PDF to Audio Converter
Overview
This Python script is designed to convert a PDF file into an audio file using text-to-speech technology. It extracts the text content from the PDF and then uses a text-to-speech engine to convert that text into an audio file, which can be helpful for people who prefer audio content or have visual impairments.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

Python: You can download it from Python's official website.

pyttsx3 library: This library provides a simple interface to text-to-speech engines in Python. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install pyttsx3
PyPDF2 library: This library is used to extract text from PDF files. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install PyPDF2
Usage
Download the Script

First, download the pdf_to_audio.py script to your computer.

Run the Script

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script. Then, run the script with the following command:

Copy code
python pdf_to_audio.py
Provide PDF File and Output Path

The script will prompt you to provide the following information:

PDF File Path: Enter the path to the PDF file you want to convert to audio.

Audio Output Path: Specify the path where you want to save the resulting audio file. You should provide a file name with an appropriate extension like .mp3.

Conversion Process

The script will read the PDF file, extract its text content, clean the text, and convert it to audio using text-to-speech technology.

Audio Output

Once the conversion is complete, you will find the generated audio file at the specified output path.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the script:

bash
Copy code
python pdf_to_audio.py
Enter the path to your PDF file (e.g., example.pdf).
Specify the output path for the audio file (e.g., output_audio.mp3).
